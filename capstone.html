      <h3>the capstone project !</h3>
      <p> The topic for my capstone project is based on comapring the performance and uses of Containerization and Virtualization. Below you will see the final proposal for the project.</p>

      <p>Virtualization and container deployment are two technologies with the intentions
          of creating a more efficient network environment. Both are used in many IT departments
          across the world to achieve just that, more efficient use of resources. In fact, “Over 75
          percent of organizations utilize server virtualization. Some firms even report that they
          have virtualized or plan to virtualize 90 percent of their servers” (Karl, 2017). The
          purpose of this project is going to be to have an answer as to which would be more
          effective and efficient to use in a business environment. To do this, two applications
          have been chosen to use and investigate their features. VMware was selected to cover
          virtual machines, and Docker for containerization. The belief is that the results of this
          will show that the container style of deployment is more efficient, defined by resource
          use, than a classic virtualization system. This is because instead of creating other
          operating systems to run applications off of, like virtual machines, all that is needed is
          the runtime that the container uses then the libraries of the applications. Key points that
          will be assessed are time to deploy, cost, and ease of use. In the end, the researcher
          should have a greater understanding of both methods and what situations would using
          one be more beneficial than the other.
          Keywords: Virtualization, containers, VMware, Docker, deployment

        Problem Statement

        Below are some questions about both these topics and their relation:

        What are the key differences between virtualization and containerization?
        - In virtual machines the hardware is being virtualized to run multiple instances of
        an OS
        - Containers virtualize an OS so that multiple workloads can run on one instance
        of that OS
        What are some of the benefits of using containers?
        - Improved ease of creating and deploying applications, consistent resource usage
        - Since only one operating system is used, bug fixes and deploying patches is
        easier to do.

      <p> i'll be using this page to contain all the data that I get from actually doing the performance comparison on the linux machine COVID-19 UPDATE: can't get data just yet because I was relying on JMC being open to use their computers and harddrives... now I can't </p>
